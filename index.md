I am an undergraduate senior at Rice University in the department of Computer Science, where I am advised by [Prof. Anshumali Shrivastava](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~as143/) and [Prof. Anastasios Kyrillidis](http://akyrillidis.github.io/about/). I am interested in Machine Learning, and more recently semisupervised learning, optimization, and GANs.

In 2018, I interned at 3Red Trading, where I applied Machine Learning to trade equities. Since 2017, I've been working on Valhalla Healthcare, a startup aiming to reduce physician burnout by automating documentation, augmented with Machine Learning.
