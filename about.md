I'm currently a senior at Rice University studying Computer Science. This is my blog for recent Machine Learning research which I am involved in. I'm conducting research on hashing with Professor Anshumali Shrivastava as well as Machine Learning optimization with Professor Anastasios Kyrillidis. In my free time I enjoy playing and watching basketball (go Stephen Curry!), soccer (go Liverpool!), taking photographs and drinking coffee.
